### How did I find differences?
First I got the output from each program into two text files using the bash script we made in lab 9. Then I used the `vimdiff` command, and then chose certain highlighted differences that caught my eye.

### Chosen Test Files
- [22.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/main/test-files/22.md)
- [201.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/main/test-files/201.md)

## Which Implementation is Correct?
### 22.md
For this test file, both implementations are incorrect. This is because the correct output is a link to "bar\*" as the backslashes are treated as escapes, and so they don't appear, and the second part in quotes is treated as the title of the link, and not part of the link itself.
- My output: ![my22](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mnohem/cse15l-lab-reports/main/images/my-output-22.png)
- The given programs output: ![their22](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mnohem/cse15l-lab-reports/main/images/their-output-22.png)
- Expected output: [bar\*]
### 201.md
For this test file, my implementation is correct. This is because there can't be any space between the closing parentheses for the name of the link, and the opening bracket for the actual link itself to be a valid link.
- My output: ![my201](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mnohem/cse15l-lab-reports/main/images/my-output-201.png)
- The given programs output: ![their201](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mnohem/cse15l-lab-reports/main/images/their-output-201.png)
- Expected output: []
