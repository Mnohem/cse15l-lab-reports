### How did I find differences?
First I got the output from each program into two text files using the bash script we made in lab 9. Then I used the `vimdiff` command, and then chose certain highlighted differences that caught my eye.

### Chosen Test Files
- [22.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/main/test-files/22.md)
- [201.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/main/test-files/201.md)

## Which Implementation is Correct?
### 22.md
For this test file, both implementations are incorrect. This is because the correct output is a link to "bar\*" as the backslashes are treated as escapes, and so they don't appear, and the second part in quotes is treated as the title of the link, and not part of the link itself.
- My output: ![my22](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mnohem/cse15l-lab-reports/main/images/my-output-22.png)
- The given programs output: ![their22](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mnohem/cse15l-lab-reports/main/images/their-output-22.png)
- Expected output: [bar\*]
#### Explanation of bug

To fix this bug we need to analyze the string inside the parentheses and remove the slashes, remove anything in quotes, and trim whitespace. To do this, we would not be able to just directly add the substring like this, we would need to do this after the if statement but before the add.

### 201.md
For this test file, my implementation is correct. This is because there can't be any space between the closing bracket for the name of the link, and the opening parentheses for the actual link itself to be a valid link.
- My output: ![my201](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mnohem/cse15l-lab-reports/main/images/my-output-201.png)
- The given programs output: ![their201](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mnohem/cse15l-lab-reports/main/images/their-output-201.png)
- Expected output: []
#### Explanation of bug

To fix this bug we need to make sure that the index of the closing bracket is only one less than the index of the opening bracket for the link before we consider the link valid. We can check for this right after getting the indices for the closing bracket and opening parentheses.
